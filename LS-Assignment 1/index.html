      <p id='gg'>Valorant is an online multiplayer computer game, produced by Riot Games. It is a first-person shooter game, consisting of two teams of five, where one team attacks and the other defends. Players control characters known as ‘agents’, who all have different abilities to use during gameplay. The game’s matchmaking system automatically groups players of similar skill together.</p>

      <li>Tactical Gameplay: Valorant emphasizes strategic gameplay where teamwork, communication, and planning are crucial. Each player selects a unique "agent" with distinct abilities that can be used strategically during matches.</li>
      <li>Unique Agents: The game features a roster of agents, each with their own set of abilities categorized into unique roles like Duelists, Initiators, Controllers, and Sentinels. These abilities can range from offensive attacks to defensive utilities and support capabilities.</li>
      <li>Objective-based Gameplay: Matches in Valorant typically involve one team attacking and the other defending a series of bomb sites. The attacking team must plant a bomb (Spike) while the defending team tries to stop them or defuse the planted Spike.</li>
      <li>Precision Shooting Mechanics: Valorant places a strong emphasis on precise aiming and shooting mechanics. Players need to master skills such as recoil control, accurate shooting, and effective use of weapons.</li>
      <li>Agent Abilities: Each agent has a unique ultimate ability that charges over time or through actions in the game. Ultimate abilities are powerful and can potentially turn the tide of a round when used strategically.</li>
      <li>Economy System: Similar to other tactical shooters, Valorant includes an economy system where players earn money for kills, planting or defusing the Spike, and winning rounds. This money is used to purchase weapons, shields, and abilities for subsequent rounds.</li>
      <li>Ranked Mode: Valorant offers a competitive ranked mode where players can test their skills and climb through different ranks, from Iron to Radiant, based on their performance in matches.</li>
